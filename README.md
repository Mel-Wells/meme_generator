# Meme Generator

## Description

The Meme Generator is a fun web application built following a tutorial from freeCodeCamp that allows users to create custom memes. Users can upload images, add captions (top and bottom text), and download their final memes. This project highlights interactive features, such as real-time preview and image downloads, and demonstrates the capabilities of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## What was used

+ Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

+ Credits: Project built following freeCodeCamp's tutorial


## How it was made

This project was developed with a focus on creating an accessible and user-friendly web application. Here is the process:

1. Initial Planning: Determined the main functionality: uploading images, adding captions, and downloading the meme.

2. HTML Structure: Designed a straightforward layout featuring input fields, buttons, and a canvas element.

3.  with CSS: Styled the interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

4. JavaScript Logic:

     + Used the Canvas API for rendering images and text.

    + Developed functions for image upload, text overlay, and image download.


5. Testing and Debugging: Tested across browsers to ensure compatibility and performance.

## What went wrong

Initially, the text rendering on the canvas didn't properly align, requiring adjustments to the font size and text positioning logic.

Debugging image scaling issues when uploading non-square images took longer than expected.

## Future improvements

Add customization options like font selection, text color, and text size.

Include drag-and-drop functionality for easier image uploads.

Implement advanced features such as image filters or stickers.

## What I learned

Deepened understanding of the Canvas API for drawing and manipulating elements in real-time.

Enhanced problem-solving skills by debugging alignment and scaling issues.

Improved project planning and execution skills by following a structured development process.
